# About

## Safe?
Yes this is safe, there have been **zero** recorded cases of a Khan account being banned for hacks (at least for now). <br>
Also if you're asking if this is a virus it is 100% open sourced forever so you can look through the code to see for yourself. <br>

## Support
I don't want to take money for this so if you would like to support me you can star the Github, it really motivates me to update as much as I can.
